older fastapi docs recommend using sqlalchemy
newer fastapi docs recommend a new ORM based on sqlalchemy and pydantic called SQLModel

for now, i will use sqlalchemy + sqlite

tutorial uses sqlalchemy + postgresql (postgresql+psycopg2) (psycopg2-binary)

db> models> user.py : uselist is very important in sqlalchemy
it indicates that this is not a one to many relationship

new interesting package: sqlalchemy-utils
> poetry add sqlalchemy-utils

utcnow from datetime is deprecated

> poetry add alembic
-- add sqlalchemy connection url to alembic.ini
-- update alembic/env.py to access models
> alembic init alembic
> alembic revision --autogenerate -m "summary"
-- view the revision file, and fix the problems, (like adding sqlalchemy-utils)
another fix: remove the role column, (alembic confuses the column name and the name of the enum, both are role)
to fix this, create the column first then add the column
> alembic upgrade head
> alembic downgrade base (the opposite of upgrade) (some seeded data were added from students.json)
